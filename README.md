This is my first remote repo on GitHub.
At first, all my repository will be for learning purposes.
I'm on the "self-taught-programmer" journey, as a hobby.
If you landed here, on my profile, please drop a message!
Feel free to comment on my code, or point out any errors, or bad practices.
I'm still beginner in programming and Python, so I appreciate all feedback.
Cheers,

@fygarcia
